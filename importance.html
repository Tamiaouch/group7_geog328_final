      <h2>COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)</h2>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic triggered societal disruptions, such as job losses

      <h2>Police Budget Cut (2020-2021)</h2>

      <h2>Police Pursuit Law (2021-2024)</h2>
      <p>In 2021, Washington law prohibited officers from pursuing suspects without “probable cause”. In 2023, lawmakers lowered the

            <div class="panel">
            <ul>
                <li>Assault can leave victims with lasting trauma. Victims often experience a range of emotional and mental

                relationships, <strong>weakening the community structure further.</strong> This can result in a cycle of fear and violence, where individuals
