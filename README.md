## Project Title

**Seattle Assault Crimes Heatmap**  

## Project Description

The **Seattle Assault Crimes Heatmap** is a dynamic, interactive web application that visualizes assault crimes in Seattle during 2020. By leveraging geographic data and spatial analysis, this web application provides a powerful visual representation of crime density across the city. The map allows users to explore the distribution of assault crimes with an intuitive zoom feature. Zooming in reveals individual data points with details, while zooming out displays broader crime trends, including hotspots where crimes are more frequent. 

This visualization tool aims to empower residents, homebuyers, community organizations, and policymakers with valuable insights into local crime patterns. By making crime data accessible and transparent, we aim to facilitate safer neighborhoods and informed decision-making in Seattle.

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to provide an accessible and easy-to-understand visualization of assault crime patterns across Seattle. By offering a heatmap that allows for both general and detailed views, this tool helps users make informed decisions about public safety, property investments, and resource allocation.

We aim to:
- Raise awareness about crime density in different neighborhoods.
- Provide actionable data for community organizations working to prevent crime.
- Assist potential homebuyers in evaluating neighborhood safety.
- Support policymakers in making data-driven decisions on crime prevention and resource allocation.

This project directly aligns with efforts to make communities safer and encourage more informed decision-making about urban living.

### Main Functions

- **Heatmap Visualization**: Displays assault crime density, highlighting areas of higher crime frequency.
- **Zooming Feature**: Allows users to zoom in and out, with detailed data available at closer zoom levels.
- **Interactive Map**: Users can interact with the map to explore crime data and identify trends in specific areas.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures that the map is viewable on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### Data Sources

The data for the Seattle Assault Crimes Heatmap is sourced from publicly available datasets:

- **Seattle Police Department**: Crime data includes types of incidents, locations, and dates.
- **Seattle Open Data Portal**: Provides access to various datasets, including crime-related information for public use.

### Applied Libraries and Web Services

This web application uses the following libraries and services:

- **Mapbox GL JS**: A JavaScript library for rendering interactive maps with vector tiles. Used for displaying crime data as a heatmap and providing interactive features.
- **OpenStreetMap**: The base map data source, integrated through Mapbox to ensure accurate geographic data.

### Data Sensitivity & Confidentiality

Our project ensures that assault crime data is displayed responsibly, maintaining confidentiality by using aggregated data points. We avoid pinpointing exact addresses to respect privacy while still providing valuable insights into crime patterns.

We have taken the following measures to ensure data sensitivity:

- **Data Sourcing & Anonymization**: Our data comes from openly available resources like the Seattle Open Data Portal and the Seattle Police Department. To protect privacy, all data has been anonymized to prevent the identification of individuals involved in the incidents.
- **Ethical Considerations & User Responsibility**: We have taken ethical considerations into account to ensure the data is presented fairly and without bias. Users are encouraged to interpret the data responsibly, keeping its context and limitations in mind.

By implementing these measures, we aim to provide a valuable resource for understanding crime patterns while respecting the privacy and confidentiality of individuals.

### Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the Seattle Police Department for making crime data publicly available and Mapbox for providing tools that allow us to visualize geographic data. A special thanks to the open-source community for creating the libraries that power this project. This project is built on the principles of open data and transparency, which empower communities to make informed decisions.

### AI Use Disclosure

We have used generative AI tools like ChatGPT to assist in the development of this project, specifically and solely for code debugging. However, AI tools were not used to generate data or develop the core functionality of the web application.

### Other Information

The **Seattle Assault Crimes Heatmap** is designed to improve the safety and awareness of Seattle's residents by visualizing crime patterns in an interactive, user-friendly map. We hope this tool aids in informed decision-making and helps to reduce crime through community awareness.
