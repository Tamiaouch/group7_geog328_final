## Project Title

**Seattle Assault Crimes Heatmap**  

## Project Description

The **Seattle Assault Crimes Heatmap** is a dynamic, interactive web application that visualizes assault crimes in Seattle during 2020. By leveraging geographic data and spatial analysis, this web application provides a powerful visual representation of crime density across the city. The map allows users to explore the distribution of assault crimes with an intuitive zoom feature. Zooming in reveals individual data points with details, while zooming out displays broader crime trends, including hotspots where crimes are more frequent. 

This visualization tool aims to empower residents, homebuyers, community organizations, and policymakers with valuable insights into local crime patterns. By making crime data accessible and transparent, we aim to facilitate safer neighborhoods and informed decision-making in Seattle.

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to provide an accessible and easy-to-understand visualization of assault crime patterns across Seattle. By offering a heatmap that allows for both general and detailed views, this tool helps users make informed decisions about public safety, property investments, and resource allocation.

We aim to:
- Raise awareness about crime density in different neighborhoods.
- Provide actionable data for community organizations working to prevent crime.
- Assist potential homebuyers in evaluating neighborhood safety.
- Support policymakers in making data-driven decisions on crime prevention and resource allocation.

This project directly aligns with efforts to make communities safer and encourage more informed decision-making about urban living.
