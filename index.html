            <h2>About Our Project</h2>
            <p>
                This project visualizes assault crimes in Seattle during 2020 using an interactive heatmap to provide a powerful 
                visual representation of crime density across the city. By leveraging geographic data and spatial analysis, our 
                map allows users to seamlessly explore crime patterns with an intuitive zoom feature. When zoomed in, individual 
                data points become visible, offering detailed insights into specific assault incidents, including the type of crime 
                and its location. Conversely, zooming out reveals broader crime trends, highlighting hotspots and areas with higher 
                crime concentrations. This dynamic visualization not only aids residents and potential homebuyers in understanding 
                neighborhood safety but also supports community organizations, businesses, and policymakers in making data-driven decisions.
            </p>
            
            <p>The motivation behind this project stems from the critical need for accessible and transparent crime data. Assault 
                crimes have a profound impact on community well-being, influencing everything from public perception of safety to 
                property values and economic stability. In recent years, Seattle has seen shifts in crime trends due to a variety of 
                social, economic, and policy-driven factors. By providing this heatmap, we aim to bridge the gap between raw data and 
                actionable insights, empowering the public to make informed choices. Additionally, this project aligns with broader 
                efforts to promote safety, advocate for equitable resource distribution, and support crime prevention initiatives by 
                visualizing where safety measures might be needed most.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Sensitivity & Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>
                Our project ensures that assault crime data is displayed responsibly, maintaining confidentiality by using aggregated data points. 
                We avoid pinpointing exact addresses to respect privacy while still providing valuable insights into crime patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have taken the following measures to ensure data sensitivity:
            </p>    
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Sourcing & Anonymization</strong>: Our data comes from openly available resources like the Seattle Open Data Portal and the Seattle Police Department. To protect privacy, all data has been anonymized to prevent the identification of individuals involved in the incidents.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Considerations & User Responsibility</strong>: We have taken ethical considerations into account to ensure the data is presented fairly and without bias. Users are encouraged to interpret the data responsibly, keeping its context and limitations in mind.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By implementing these measures, we aim to provide a valuable resource for understanding crime patterns while respecting the privacy and confidentiality of individuals.
